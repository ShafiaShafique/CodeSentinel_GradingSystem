# CodeSentinel_GradingSystem
This is a simple Java-based grading system for two students. It collects marks in Chemistry, Physics, and Biology (out of 100), calculates the total and percentage, and then assigns grades (A to F) based on the percentage. It uses arrays, loops, and basic input/output logic, ideal for beginners learning Java.
